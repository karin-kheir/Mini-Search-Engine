Web development refers to the work involved in developing websites for the Internet or an intranet. This can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. Web development can include web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration.

Front-end development involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. Frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue help developers build complex front-end applications efficiently. Back-end development focuses on databases, server logic, and APIs. Languages like Java, Python, PHP, and Node.js are commonly used for backend systems.

Full-stack developers handle both front-end and back-end development. Tools like Git, Docker, and cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) are widely used to manage deployment and scalability. Web development continues to evolve rapidly, driven by new frameworks, better performance practices, and the demand for more dynamic, engaging user experiences.
