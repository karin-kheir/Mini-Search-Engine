Spring is a powerful framework for building Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications easily and rapidly. The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.

Spring promotes good design practices such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming, which help developers create loosely coupled and maintainable code. Spring Boot, a sub-project of Spring, simplifies the setup of new Spring applications by providing pre-configured templates and embedded servers.

Many large-scale enterprise applications rely on Spring because it reduces boilerplate code, improves testing capabilities, and supports integration with databases, messaging systems, and web services. Developers who master Spring can build robust, scalable, and high-performance applications quickly and efficiently. Spring's ecosystem also includes Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring Cloud.
